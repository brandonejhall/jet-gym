# Volume Calculation Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the workout volume calculation in Jet-Gym to align with industry standard fitness metrics.

## Industry Standard Formula

The correct volume calculation follows this formula:

```
Volume = Sets × Reps × Weight
```

For Jet-Gym, we calculate volume per set and sum across all completed sets in a workout.

## Implementation Details

### Volume Calculation Rules

1. **Weight-based exercises**: `Volume = Weight × Reps`
   - Example: Bench Press 135 lbs × 10 reps = 1,350 lbs

2. **Bodyweight exercises**: `Volume = (Estimated Bodyweight × 0.5) × Reps`
   - Example: Push-ups 15 reps = 150 lbs × 0.5 × 15 = 1,125 lbs
   - Uses 150 lbs as default bodyweight estimate
   - Applies 50% multiplier for bodyweight exercises

3. **Time-based exercises**: `Volume = (Duration in minutes) × (Estimated Weight) × 0.5`
   - Example: Plank 60 seconds = (60/60) × 150 lbs × 0.5 = 75 lbs
   - For weighted time-based exercises, uses the provided weight
   - Conservative 0.5 intensity multiplier for time-based exercises

### Key Improvements Made

1. **Unified Volume Calculation**: All exercise types now contribute to total volume
2. **Time-based Exercise Support**: Previously excluded, now properly calculated
3. **Bodyweight Exercise Estimation**: Provides reasonable volume estimates for bodyweight exercises
4. **Completed Sets Only**: Only counts sets marked as completed
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Properly handles null values, zero reps, and invalid data

### Methods Added

#### `calculateSetVolume(ExerciseSet set)`
- Main volume calculation method
- Handles all exercise types (weight-based, bodyweight, time-based)
- Returns volume in pounds

#### `estimateTimeBasedVolume(ExerciseSet set)`
- Estimates volume for time-based exercises
- Uses duration and estimated weight
- Applies intensity multiplier for conservative estimates

### Updated Analytics Methods

1. **`getWeeklyVolume()`**: Now includes all exercise types in volume calculation
2. **`getMuscleGroupVolume()`**: Properly distributes volume across muscle groups
3. **Personal Records**: Updated to use volume-based comparison instead of weight × reps

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite created (`AnalyticsServiceVolumeTest.java`) covering:
- Weight-based exercises
- Bodyweight exercises  
- Time-based exercises
- Weighted time-based exercises
- Edge cases (zero reps, null values)

All tests pass and validate the correct volume calculations.

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Metrics**: Volume now reflects all training modalities
2. **Better Insights**: Users can track progress across all exercise types
3. **Industry Standard**: Aligns with fitness industry volume calculations
4. **Comprehensive Tracking**: No exercise types are excluded from analytics
5. **Improved Motivation**: Users see progress even with bodyweight and time-based exercises

## Example Calculations

| Exercise Type | Weight | Reps/Time | Volume Calculation | Result |
|---------------|--------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| Bench Press | 135 lbs | 10 reps | 135 × 10 | 1,350 lbs |
| Push-ups | Bodyweight | 15 reps | 150 × 0.5 × 15 | 1,125 lbs |
| Plank | Bodyweight | 60 sec | (60/60) × 150 × 0.5 | 75 lbs |
| Weighted Plank | 25 lbs | 45 sec | (45/60) × 25 × 0.5 | 9.375 lbs |

## Frontend Impact

The frontend components (`WeeklyVolumeChart.tsx` and `MuscleGroupHeatmap.tsx`) will automatically benefit from these improvements as they consume the updated volume data from the backend API.

### Date Range Labels

The weekly volume chart now displays meaningful date ranges instead of generic "Week 1", "Week 2" labels:

- **Same month**: "Jul 1-7", "Aug 5-11"
- **Cross month**: "Jul 29-Aug 4", "Dec 30-Jan 5"
- **Year boundary**: "Dec 30-Jan 5"

The frontend has been updated to use these date range labels directly from the backend, providing users with clear temporal context for their volume trends.

No additional frontend changes are required - the existing components will display more accurate and comprehensive volume data with proper date ranges.
